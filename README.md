# Bamazon
a CLI app that allows its user to make orders from a SQL database of items.
items can be chosen to be ordered by using their id number.
the user will then enter how many of the item they want.
if the user enter a valid id number and the item is in stock the order will be processed, and fulfilled.
and the stock number for that item will be decrementented by the amount the user ordered.
if the user enters an invalid id number or the item is out of stock the order will no be processed.
